I am a graduate student at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm) of [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology]. My research interests include computer vision, cross-modal retrieval, etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Guoqing Zhang](https://zhguoqing.github.io/) at [School of Computer Science](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/main.htm), Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.
